## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learnt how to use TailwindCSS more through the use of tailwind Docs, most expecially the aspect of responsiveness. I also learnt how to use Javascript forLoop on a project.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div className="lg:max-2xl:h-full lg:max-2xl:w-1/2 lg:max-2xl:rounded-x-2xl shadow-2xl py-4 px-4"></div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
 let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    sum += data[i].score;

  }
  const average = sum / data.length;
  
  const total = Math.round(average);
 console.log(total);
```

### Continued development

I would love to continue developing more on the different screens responsiveness. This seems to be a little bit problematic for me but I look forward to developing it.
